# StratusGrid-PokeApi

Hi. This is a small project that retrieves some of the Pokemon data from the [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co) and calculate the average weight and height of all pokemon and the average weight and height per type.

Inside the <code>.\PokeApiStatusGrid\bin\Debug</code> you'll find a builded version so you can run it without opening the solution.
